contracts:
  - name: PixelMap OG Contract
    address: "0x015a06a433353f8db634df4eddf0c109882a15ab"

      All data for each tile is stored directly on the OG contract.  The

      Base91 encoding + PAKO compression to minimize gas fees.

    notes: |
      It's important to note, that the original PixelMap contract contains the
      ability to buy, sell, and update tiles.  The one thing it does NOT have,
      is the ability to transfer directly, or sell to a specific person.  In
      order to wrap a tile, you essentially have to list it for sale, and buy it
      from yourself.  Because ANYONE can buy it during the wrapping process, It's
      important to set it for sale at a price that you'd be happy with receiving the
      money if someone else buys it from you (always wrap above OpenSea floor!).

      Once wrapped, you can always transfer safely or sell to specific buyers, or
      even unwrap if you'd like.  You can wrap your tiles via the PixelMap.io website.
