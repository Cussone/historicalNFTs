excerpt: |
  Pixelmap is the oldest verified NFT collection on OpenSea, the first billboard style NFT, 
  and provides the ability to create, display, and immortalize artwork directly on the Blockchain.
totalSupply: 3970
contracts:
  - name: PixelMap OG Contract
    address: "0x015a06a433353f8db634df4eddf0c109882a15ab"
    notes: |
      All data for each tile is stored directly on the OG contract.  The
      image data for each tile is stored as hex triplets (768 char total), with
      Base91 encoding + PAKO compression to minimize gas fees.
  - name: PixelMap Wrapper,
    address: "0x050dc61dfb867e0fe3cf2948362b6c0f3faf790b"
    notes: |
      It's important to note, that the original PixelMap contract contains the
      ability to buy, sell, and update tiles.  The one thing it does NOT have,
      is the ability to transfer directly, or sell to a specific person.  In
      order to wrap a tile, you essentially have to list it for sale, and buy it
      from yourself.  Because ANYONE can buy it during the wrapping process, It's
      important to set it for sale at a price that you'd be happy with receiving the
      money if someone else buys it from you (always wrap above OpenSea floor!).

      Once wrapped, you can always transfer safely or sell to specific buyers, or
      even unwrap if you'd like.  You can wrap your tiles via the PixelMap.io website.

faq:
  - question: What is PixelMap?
    answer: Created in 2016, PixelMap is considered the second-oldest NFT, the
      first "billboard-style" on Ethereum, and provides the ability to create,
      display, and immortalize artwork directly on the Blockchain.

  - question: Where can I find the historical gitter chat from 2016?
    answer: https://gitter.im/Pixel-Map/Lobby (Chat dating back to the launch in 2016)
  - question: How do I get the Tile Owner role?
    answer: If you own a PixelMap tile, head to the collabland-join channel to verify and receive the "Tile Owner" role.
  - question: How many tiles are there?
    answer: 3,970 in total, numbered 0 through 3,969 (the last tile is invisible ;))
  - question: What's the difference between a wrapped and unwrapped tile?
    answer:
      PixelMap was launched in 2016, predating the ERC-721 standard by nearly a year.
      Because of that, while you can still buy/sell/update unwrapped tiles, to list
      them on exchanges like OpenSea, LooksRare, etc., they have to be "wrapped."
      Please note you can ALWAYS unwrap a wrapped tile and vice versa.
      Most people choose to leave theirs wrapped for ease of use.
  - question: Can you change tile images and metadata after you wrap?
    answer: Yes.  The wrapper exposes all OG contract functionality.
  - question: Who created PixelMap?
    answer: "Created by Ken Erwin (Discord: kendog2012#3125, Twitter: @kenerwin88)"
  - question: Which tile was the first to have an image?
    answer: "#1984, set to a spider.  Wallet owned by Ken, password is still unknown sadly! ðŸ˜„"
  - question: How much did it cost to buy a tile in 2016?
    answer: All 3,970 tiles were listed at 2E at launch.  At the time, that was
      roughly $20, with 20-30 sales.  Most tiles were relisted at 0.35E in August
      2021, selling instantly.  Others sold via lottery for 0.7E.  They now often sell for over $10k.
  - question: Can more PixelMap tiles be minted?
    answer: No, a limit of 3,970 is hardcoded into the original contract.
  - question: Why aren't there 3,970 tiles on OpenSea etc.?
    answer: Exchanges can only see "wrapped" tiles.  Most of the "unwrapped"
      tiles appear to be held by long-term HODLERS.
  - question: Are there many "DEAD" tiles that will never have an image?
    answer:
      No, the vast majority were sold in August 2021 (with a value over $10k+).
      It is unlikely that the wallets holding them are missing.  Most owners from
      2016 have been found, with an estimated ten tiles or less missing (and
      already have an image on them).
  - question: How do I wrap my tile?
    answer: Visit https://pixelmap.io/, log in with MetaMask, then click the
      "Wrapper" link at the top left.  It will guide you through the process.
      TLDR, you buy the tile from yourself using the wrapper contract.

  - question: How do I update my tile?

  - question: Where can I read more about the history of PixelMap?
    answer: https://adamamcbride.medium.com/pixel-map-lost-2016-nft-project-78fc00e62179
  - question: How can I follow official PixelMap news?
    answer:
      "We regularly post updates in the announcements channel and tweet from https://twitter.com/pixelmapnft.
      For technical updates, all of PixelMap is open-sourced and available here:  https://github.com/Pixel-Map/pixelmap.io"
  - question: Is there a Dune Dashboard, how can we track distribution, etc.?
    answer:
      Yes! https://dune.xyz/rantum/NFT-Collection-Dashboard?contract_address=x050dc61dfb867e0fe3cf2948362b6c0f3faf790b --
      Please note, it can ONLY track wrapped tiles.
  - question: I want a tile, which one should I buy!
    answer:
      First off, welcome to the family :D.  Secondly, it ultimately depends on
      what you like!  Many people have placed a higher value on tiles near the center,
      on edges, on groups of tiles, or maybe you prefer the history of a specific tile?
      Also, you CAN update the image and URL on the tile (stored directly on-chain).
      A floor tile is always a safe bet, but if one looks a bit cooler for a bit
      more, we don't blame you.
  - question: What does on-chain mean?
    answer: Most NFTs do NOT store the art and other details on the Blockchain,
      as it is significantly cheaper to point to a link on IPFS or even a standard webserver.
  - question: How do I make a private sale on OpenSea?

  - question: What is the secret/invisible tile?
    answer: https://link.medium.com/KL5kH3ZA9ib
  - question: What was the "rediscovery"?
    answer: "In August 2021, Adam McBride, an NFT Archaeologist, discovered
      PixelMap's contract while digging for old projects.  He then located the
      creator (Ken Erwin) and helped revive the project (it had laid dormant from
      2017-2020, before the explosion in interest in NFTs).  You can read the
      original article here:  https://adamamcbride.medium.com/pixel-map-lost-2016-nft-project-78fc00e62179"
  - question: What is a PixelMap Time Capsule?
    answer: "Time Capsules document a period in PixelMap's history and are given
      to the owners of tiles that fit the requirements.  For example, the 'OG 18x18'
      time capsule celebrates the first 324 tiles (18x18) to have an image on them.
      You can read more about them here: https://pixelmap.io/timecapsule, or find
      them on OpenSea at https://opensea.io/collection/pixelmap-time-capsules."
